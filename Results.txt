Reminder! Code (and everything else) for this model can be found [here](https://github.com/sauterb/ncaawPredikt). The code for the specific LSTM model used is in the file *NN_models.py*.
  
The results of the model ended up being very encouraging for its prospects as a useful tool for basketball fans. The plot below shows the training accuracy vs. loss (binary cross entropy) of the model over its 100 training epochs. It can be seen that training accuracy starts at roughly 50% (baseline for binary prediction) and quickly shoots up before reaching just over 85% at the end. More complex models and more training epochs were both tested and it was found that training accuracy could be pushed over 95% but the model was clearly overfitting in those situations. Therefore, the model was intentionally stopped before it tuned itself too specifically to the training data.
