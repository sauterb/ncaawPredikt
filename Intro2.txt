Therefore, this website showcases a project that attempts to fill that void by creating an accurate and up-to-date resource for predicting the outcome of women's collegiate basketball games. This model has been titled *NNostradamus* after the 16th-century French astrologer known for predicting the future. The double letter at the start of the name refers to the model's use of Neural Networks, a technical description of which can be found in the Analysis section. Users can count on this model for accurate predictions of NCAA women's basketball that stay up-to-date with the click of a button. After games are played, the user can relaunch the website or simply press the update button to incorporate the most recent games into the model and see the predictions for the next ones.  
  
Predictions are included for all Power 5 teams (the five largest collegiate conferences in the NCAA). Due to differences in recruiting resources, play styles can vary widely at smaller and lower-division schools. Therefore, they are not included in creating the model and their predictions are not output on this website. Basketball is a streaky game. Often the teams that are best at the start of their season fall flat in the playoffs and vice versa. Therefore, NNostradamus makes predictions based on a team's results from their last seven games. Further information about data prep and model features can be found in the 'Data Prep' section of the website.
