As can be seen in the previous sections, a model was created that is easy for a non-technical user to navigate and provides clear predictions of upcoming women's college basketball games. The goal of this project is to fill a void in the sporting world by providing a space where fans of the smaller, but fast-growing, NCAA women's game can come to engage with the sport and get excited about future matchups that they may want to watch and/or attend.

One of the major advantages of this model is not just its accuracy but its ability to show confidence in its prediction. This is especially useful for fans of the sport. Users may want to know if a game between two teams is going to be a nailbiter or a blowout. By examining the predictions from NNostradamus, they can see whether it is confident one team will win (e.g. >90%) or unsure (indicating a good, close game).
