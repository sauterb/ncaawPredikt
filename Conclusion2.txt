The ability of the model to reach a relatively high degree of accuracy with the features that it uses speaks to a few things about the game of women's collegiate basketball. First, as predicted, teams' performances change throughout the season. By predicting the next game based on a team's results in its previous seven, the model has some advantage over using an entire season's data which may be skewed by early-season outliers. This can be seen year in and year out with teams that make dazzling runs in the NCAA tournament despite lackluster early results and the model's validation of this trend speaks to its usefulness.  
  
Secondly, the opponent of a game matters. Some teams coast through easy schedules and some teams play grueling conference slates (Hello Pac-12 and Sko Buffs). By accounting for the past and current opponents' most recent RPI ranking and achieving success with its predictions, NNostradamus demonstrates that beating up on bad teams doesn't necessarily predict future success. Fans of teams on winning streaks that haven't played tough games will be able to use this tool as a reality check, seeing that they may still not be favored against a high-RPI opponent even if their team has won seven in a row.  
  
The other side of the coin is that the model has its shortcomings. It doesn't get close to 100% success rates, rendering it a tool that should be used purely recreationally, not to bet money or risk anything with high stakes. This is one of the great joys of sports though. If the outcome could be predetermined, people wouldn't watch sports, and basketball games wouldn't have the wild, passionate fanbases clinging to threads of hope that their team can come out on top. So users are encouraged to use NNostradamus for fun, watch the games, come back and repeat. Don't expect perfection, but have fun and enjoy the ride!
