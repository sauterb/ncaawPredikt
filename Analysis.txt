The model used for this project is a long short-term memory network (LSTM). LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network that betters a simple RNN by capturing and maintaining the dependencies from early in sequential data. This is why they are colloquially thought of as having a "good memory". They implement this feature using an input gate (dictates flow of new information), a forget gate (what information to discard from the memory cell), and an output gate (what is passed to the next LSTM cell (recurrence!). Because a season of sports games is nothing more than a sequence of data, in which past data points are correlated with future ones, LSTMs are uniquely suited to capturing season-long trends within sports teams. A flowchart representation of an LSTM can be seen in the image below.
