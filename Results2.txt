There was significant tuning of hyperparameters necessary to reduce overfitting (the curtailment of epochs, the addition of a dropout layer, and the reduction of neurons in the dense layer). Early iterations of the model had very poor testing accuracy and, even when this rose, the model output overly confident predictions that made it not useful in a sector that offers no certainties (sports). **The final accuracy on the test dataset was 82%**. This is a relatively high accuracy in the world of sports predictions.  
  
In order to make the final predictions, data is pulled for the current season (2023, the code will need to be tweaked for the website to continue to update next season). The data is cleaned and prepared as described in the *Data Preparation* section with the exception being that for each team, only the last seven games they've played are compiled into the sequential feature arrays. NNostradamus makes predictions for each team based on these feature arrays.   
  
The team's next game marked as 'scheduled' rather than 'closed' in the season data is marked as their next game and displayed on the *Scheduled Games and Predictions* tab of the project website. The model's sigmoid output is clamped at (0.1%, 99.9%) because there are no certainties in sports.
