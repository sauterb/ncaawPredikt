The data used in the training, testing, and ongoing deployment of this project comes from [SportRadar](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/basketball/NCAA_Womens_Basketball_v8#ncaa-womens-basketball-api-overview). Their API for NCAA Women's Basketball is used to extract scheduling data, RPI data, and season statistics for all the teams used in this project. The data from the API arrives in the JSON format where it is parsed by the data processing section of the code. The JSON files used in this model can be found (along with all other project files) on [Github](https://github.com/sauterb/ncaawPredikt). The functions for processing and cleaning the data can be found under the filename *data_processing.py* (also on Github).  
  
Using the scheduling data retrieved by the API, the data processing function iterates over all the games in the season and assigns any completed games that involve a Power 5 team to an array within a custom class that has been hard-coded for each team.  
  
Then, for each game within a team's season, the result (boolean win/loss), the margin of victory, team RPI (ranking), opponent RPI (ranking), and home-court advantage (boolean) are extracted. The margin of victory is then averaged on a per-game basis.  
  
Finally, for each team's list of games, the feature arrays are spliced into "snapshots" of seven games (in order to deduce the team's recent performance), giving the data the sequential nature that the long short-term memory neural network used in the final model is optimized for. Boolean results and the average margin of victory are offset backward by one index so that the features for any given game are team RPI, opponent RPI, average margin of victory (heading into the game), the previous game's result, and home-court advantage. Without these offsets, the result of the game would be embedded into the features and the model would not be useful for predicting anything. Seven-game snapshots are taken every five games in order to capture the various parts of a given season without including too much repeat data.  
  
This array of features has the shape (n_samples, 7, 5) corresponding to n_samples of 7-game sequences with five features that are used as an input array X for the neural network. The target array for the model, y, is simply an array of the outcomes of the seven games in a given snapshot. X and y arrays are split 80%/20% into training and testing data. 
  
This process could be repeated for any year the API has statistics for, and the snapshots of games simply appended to the X array. However, due to the disruption of the COVID seasons (unpredictable outcomes due to sick and/or exposed players) and the evolution of play style over the years, only very recent seasons are considered.
